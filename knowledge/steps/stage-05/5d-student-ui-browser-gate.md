# Session 5d — Report — Student Quiz UI + Browser Gate + Real-Provider Smoke

## Linked documents

## What shipped (from `git diff` + new files)
Frontend (Next.js):
- `frontend/src/features/quiz/mcq.tsx` — **API-agnostic** MCQ components (`MultipleChoiceQuestionCard`, `AnswerOptionButton`, `AnswerFeedbackPanel`, `QuizResultSummary`): props + callbacks only, **zero `lib/api` imports** (Stage 7 reuse). Math = escaped plain text (D-MATH: React escapes, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`). Answers final (D-ABANDON: select = submit).
- `frontend/src/features/quiz/PostClassQuizPanel.tsx` — the stateful panel wiring the components to `api.quiz`: states unavailable/available/generating/in-progress/results/failed + history line; the **4.5d backoff poll** for `generating` (setTimeout not setInterval, 1.5×→12s, 5-min wall-clock cap, NO 60s hard timeout, unmount-safe); resume via sessionStorage (read-only getAttempt, never auto-creates); failed → sanitized message + Start Over.
- `frontend/src/lib/api/wrapper.ts` — `api.quiz.*` (getAvailability/start/getAttempt/answer/complete/getAttemptsSummary), each `withAuthRecovery`.
- `frontend/src/features/content/student/StudentSectionDetail.tsx` — mounts `<PostClassQuizPanel>` after the summaries.

Tests / smoke:
- `tests/e2e/5d-post-class-quiz.spec.ts` — the browser gate (deterministic pipeline): available→Start→generating→10 Q→answer (1 wrong→red feedback + "Saved to your mistakes" + MistakeRecord row; 9 correct)→complete→90%→`completed_quiz` event (same txn)→Start Over→new 10-Q attempt→all-correct→100%→`perfect_quiz_score`; NEGATIVE two-surface (non-student 403; unpublish→404 on availability + detail).
- `backend/scripts/gate3_quiz_smoke.py` — the rule-11 real-provider smoke (reasoning route, model-ID echo vs configured `LLM_DETAILED_MODEL_ID`, parseable 10-Q quiz).

## Verification — honest status

**Gate 3 (real-provider smoke): GREEN ✅** — run against the configured provider (synthetic summary):
```
response model echo : MBZUAI-IFM/K2-Think-v2  (expected MBZUAI-IFM/K2-Think-v2)  -> OK   ← rule 11 LIVE
parseable           : YES (PostClassQuiz, 10 questions);  one-correct-per-q: OK;  status 200; 104.1s
PASS
```
Recorded in [[steps/stage-05/5d-real-provider-smoke]]. The original 8000-token run returned
`finish_reason='length'`; F-5d-1 raised the prompt budget to 16000 and the re-confirm run returned
`finish_reason='stop'` with a parseable 10-question quiz.

**Frontend type-check: GREEN ✅** — `tsc --noEmit` exit 0 (the new components/panel/wrapper, borrowing the
frontend image's node_modules — deps unchanged). The generated client + new code compile clean.

**Quiz behavior (what the browser gate asserts): VERIFIED via pytest ✅** — availability, start/resume,
generation, answer ordering + option-identity correctness + DB-idempotent re-answer, MistakeRecord on
incorrect, atomic complete + `completed_quiz`/`perfect_quiz_score` events, Start Over, the S7
unpublish-mid-attempt 404 + zero-events-while-hidden, and 403/404 gating are all proven green by the 5b
generation tests + the 5c `test_quiz_endpoints.py` (full suite **437 passed**).

**Gate 1 (live browser gate run): GREEN ✅** — run against this workspace's own stack (operator authorized
tearing down the sibling `stage-55` stack + supplied `/Desktop/LMS/test2/.env` + `.env.e2e`):
```
$ npx playwright test tests/e2e/5d-post-class-quiz.spec.ts --workers=1
  ✓  1 [chromium] › 5d post-class quiz browser gate (16.1s)
  1 passed
```
In real Chromium against the real backend (deterministic provider): student opens published lecture w/
completed detailed summary → quiz available → Start → generating → **10 questions render** → answer (1
wrong → red feedback + "Saved to your mistakes" + a `mistake_records` row; 9 correct) → complete → **90%**
→ `completed_quiz` event (same txn) → Start Over → **new attempt, 10 new question rows** → all correct →
**100%** → `perfect_quiz_score` event → non-student **403** → **S7 unpublish-mid-attempt: 404 on
detail/complete/availability + zero events while hidden → re-publish → resume (in_progress preserved)**.
Stack: `kyiv` project (own images/network), db/redis internal-only (sibling stacks hold the host ports),
backend :8000, frontend :3001 (a leftover host `next-server` holds :3000), `LLM_PROVIDER=deterministic`,
migrated 0013→0020, seeded via `seed.mjs`. (One spec-helper fix during the run: `runPsqlJson` needs the
SQL to return `json_*(...)::text` — corrected; second run green.)

### Browser-gate runbook (isolated stack — no sibling contact)
```bash
# 1. fresh DB + isolated redis index (reuse the shared db/redis SERVERS only)
docker exec test2-db-1 psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE xyz_lms_5d"
# 2. backend + workers (this workspace's code), port-remapped, redis /1, deterministic provider
#    (compose override or `docker run` per service): DATABASE_URL=...xyz_lms_5d,
#    REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/1, ENABLE_DETAILED_SUMMARY=true, LLM_PROVIDER=deterministic,
#    CORS_ORIGINS includes the frontend origin; backend on :8001; alembic upgrade head (→0020).
# 3. frontend: install deps + next dev/build on :3001 with .env.e2e (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=:8001,
#    NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_TEST_HOOKS=true, Supabase URL/anon key from the shared supabase stack).
# 4. seed Supabase auth users + app_users: `set -a; . ./.env.e2e; set +a; node tests/e2e/fixtures/seed.mjs`
# 5. run (serial — the run-manifest race is real):
#    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001 \
#    E2E_RUN_ID=e2e-$(date +%s)-$(openssl rand -hex 3) \
#    npx playwright test tests/e2e/5d-post-class-quiz.spec.ts --workers=1
```

## Deviations / residuals
- Real-provider smoke was agent-run with the in-env key; re-run after any key rotation (4.5d runbook).
- No open Stage 5d gate residual remains: Gate 1 browser and Gate 3 real-provider smoke both passed, and
  F-5d-1 was re-confirmed at `finish_reason='stop'`.

## Modified prior sessions
- Session 4.7 (`StudentSectionDetail.tsx`) — added the `<PostClassQuizPanel>` mount below the summaries (additive; summary behavior unchanged).
- Session 5c (`wrapper.ts`) — added `api.quiz.*` (additive).

## Close-the-loop checklist
- [x] Reusable API-agnostic MCQ components shipped (Stage 7 reuse)
- [x] 4.5d-pattern generating poll (no 60s timeout)
- [x] Real-provider smoke GREEN (rule 11 model-ID echo vs configured id)
- [x] Frontend tsc GREEN
- [x] Quiz behavior verified by pytest (437)
- [x] **Live browser gate run GREEN** (1 passed, real Chromium, `--workers=1`)
- [x] F-5d-1 resolved + re-confirmed (`finish_reason='stop'` at 16000)
- [x] Report + 5d-real-provider-smoke doc written; STATUS/log updated; open-questions reconciled
- [x] **Roadmap Stage 5 → FULLY VERIFIED** (Gate 1 browser + Gate 3 real-provider both green)

## Change history
- 2026-06-16 — [Session 5d] UI + gate spec + smoke built; Gate 3 GREEN, frontend tsc GREEN, behavior pytest-verified; Gate 1 (live browser run) pending the isolated-stack standup.
- 2026-06-16 — [Session 5d, cont.] Operator authorized the stack standup (tore down sibling `stage-55`, supplied `/Desktop/LMS/test2/.env`+`.env.e2e`). **Gate 1 browser gate GREEN** (1 passed). F-5d-1 fix re-confirmed at 16000 (`finish_reason='stop'`). **Stage 5 = FULLY VERIFIED** (both gates green).
- 2026-06-16 22:46 — [Session 5e] removed stale Gate 1 / truncation residual wording after review-fix verification; no product behavior changed in 5d UI files.
- 2026-06-17 — [Knowledge fix] added the missing 5d spec and plan, and linked the spec-plan-report trio.
